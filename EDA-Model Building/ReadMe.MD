Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Model Building - AQI Commute Advisor

This section focuses on understanding the collected data through visualization and training machine learning models to predict air quality.

Goal

Analyze the final_dataset.csv to identify patterns, trends, seasonality, and correlations related to PM2.5 pollution across different cities.

Engineer relevant features for time-series forecasting.

Train, evaluate, and save two types of models:

A Regressor to predict the numerical PM2.5 value.

A Classifier to predict a user-friendly ("quirky") AQI category directly.
